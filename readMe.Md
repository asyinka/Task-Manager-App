    1. Be toggled between light and dark mode
    2. Add task
    3. Delete a task
    4. Mark task category on the form
    5. Display a modular (form) to enter task

## Features to be added

    Part of the App still to be added for completion:

     ~~Display task category on the right panel~~ -[x]

    1. Clear completed task
    2. Edit a task

## Problems/issues

    This project contains unresolved issues stated below:

    - Font color of the footer text - only the color of the clicked footer is meant to change to white. But the font color of all footer elements changes to white once one of them is clicked.
    - The checkbox keps taking the state of the first task (either checked or unchecked) after clicking the footer or re-rendering.
    - when modal panel is cancelled, task input and category isn't cleared

## To be addressed later on

- ~~Set input to take atleast a word~~ -[x]
- properly style the U.I to taste
